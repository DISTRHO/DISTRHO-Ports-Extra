/**
	SplitComponent is a simple "splitter window" in which two child components are divided by a split bar that can be moved.\n
	\n
	SplitComponent is useful when you want to divide an area into two halves and let the user move a middle split bar
	to resize the halves. You can split the area either vertically or horizontally. You can also set a "gravity" amount for
	the middle split bar so that when you resize the window the split bar will move proportionally to grow or shrink the
	child components.\n
	\n
	By default, a SplitComponent fills the entire area of it's parent. To limit its size within the parent, call
	FitToParent(false) and then set the bounds as needed.
	\n
	SplitComponents can be nested so that you can create more complex divisions, but since a SplitComponent fills the entire
	area of it's parent, it should be put inside another component first.
	\n
	To use the SplitComponent, you supply two child components to be the left and right sides (or top and bottom for a
	horzontal split). Here's an example:

	@code{.cpp}

	MyLeftComponent myLeftComponent;
	MyRightComponent myRightComponent;
	SplitComponent* pSplitComponent = new SplitComponent(myLeftComponent, myRightComponent);

	pSplitComponent->SetSplitBarPosition(getWidth() / 2);	// Set the split bar to halfway so the area is divided equally.
															// The split bar thickness is 8 pixels by default, but you can change it.

	addAndMakeVisible(pSplitComponent);		// Add the SplitComponent to this component is, (Maybe the MainComponent)

	@endcode

	If it's more convenient, you can construct an empty SplitComponent first, and then add the left and right child components later.\n
	\n
	Note that when the SplitComponent is resized or its split bar is moved, it resizes the child components.
	So if you have a child component that wants to resize itself according to its parent's size (for example, it
	fills the area of its parent) you need to first enclose it in another component. This can be as simple as
	just a Component object. For example, say that  MyLeftComponent above wants to fill the area of its parent,
	you could implement it like this:

	@code{.cpp}

	MyLeftComponent myLeftComponent;
	MyRightComponent myRightComponent;

	Component leftPanel;
	leftPanel.addAndMakeVisible(myLeftComponent);

	SplitComponent* pSplitComponent = new SplitComponent(leftPanel, myRightComponent);

	...etc.
	@endcode

	This would be the case when nesting a SplitComponent that is set to fit to the area of it's parent.\n
	\n
	The split bar conforms to whatever look and feel you've set since it calls drawStretchableLayoutResizerBar() to paint itself.
