/**
 * CsoundPerformanceThread(Csound *)
 * CsoundPerformanceThread(CSOUND *)
 *
 * Performs a score in a separate thread until the end of score is reached,
 * the playback (which is paused by default) is stopped by calling
 * CsoundPerformanceThread::Stop(), or an error occurs.
 * The constructor takes a Csound instance pointer as argument; it assumes
 * that csoundCompile() was called successfully before creating the
 * performance thread. Once the playback is stopped for one of the above
 * mentioned reasons, the performance thread calls csoundCleanup() and
 * returns.

  An example program using the CsoundPerformanceThread class

#include <stdio.h>
#include "csound.hpp"
#include "csPerfThread.hpp"

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
 int result=0;
 Csound cs;
 csoundInitialize(NULL,NULL,NULL);
 result = cs.Compile(argc,argv);

 if(!result)
 {
   CsoundPerformanceThread perfThread(cs.GetCsound());
   perfThread.Play(); // Starts performance
   while(perfThread.GetStatus() == 0); // nothing to do here...
                                       // but you could process input events, graphics etc
   perfThread.Stop();  // Stops performance. In fact, performance should have already been
                       // finished, so this is just an example of how to stop if you need
   perfThread.Join();  // always call Join() after Stop() as a rule of thumb.
