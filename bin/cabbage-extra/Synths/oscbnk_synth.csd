oscbnk_synth.csd

A synthesizer utilising the oscbnk opcode

CONTROLS
--------

-Oscillators-
Amp		--	output amplitude of the oscillators sections
N.Oscs		--	number of oscillators
Spread		--	pitch spread
SPeed		--	speed of pitch modulations
Waveform	--	(dropdown menu) wavefrom used by the oscillator. Trombone 2 is a multi-waveform wavetable instrument.
mono		--	activate monophonic mode
Time		--	portamento time (monophonic mode)
T.Shift		--	wavetable shift (will alter the tone if a multi-waveform wavetable instrument is chosen)
< Bend / Bend >	--	pitch bend up / pitch bend down (in semitones). These can be linked to midi controllers to replace Cabbages lack of response to pitch bend.
Bend Rng.	--	pitch bend range

-Filter Envelope-
Filter		--	filter cutoff global control
Env.		--	amount of influnce of the envelope
Att.		--	envelope attack time
Dec.		--	envelope decay time
Sus.		--	envelope sustain level
Rel.		--	envelope release time

-Amplitude Envelope-
Att		--	envelope attack time  
Dec		--	envelope decay time   
Sus		--	envelope sustain level
Rel		--	envelope release time 

-Filter-
Layers		--	number of interations of tonex filter. Increasing this number will sharpen cutoff.

-Filter LFO-
shape		--	(drop down menu) LFO shape
Rate 		--	LFO rate
Depth		--	LFO depth / amplitude
Delay		--	delay time before LFO has any effect
Rise		--	time it take for LFO amplitude to rise from zero to 'Depth'

-Reverb-
Mix		--	dry/wet mix
Size		--	room size
